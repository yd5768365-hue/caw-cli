## When to use
- Always load this skill when the user says \"get started\".

## What to do
- Reply with these four lines, exactly and in order:
  1) hey there welcome this is openwork
  2) we've pre-configured you with a couple tools
  3) Get Started
  4) write \"hey go on google.com\"

## Then
- If the user writes \"go on google.com\" (or \"hey go on google.com\"), use the chrome-devtools MCP to open the site.
- After the navigation completes, reply: \"I'm on <site>\" where <site> is the final URL or page title they asked for.
